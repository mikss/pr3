# * Benchmark examples (for each nonlinear class):
#     - visualize w/ better plots;
#     - warn about _post hoc_ "just so" stories;
#     - label components by iteration step;
#     - link to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_pursuit_regression);
#     - discuss pros/cons of the various choices you can make.
# * Simultaneously document how things work
